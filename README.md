# AdaBoost-algorithm-implement-and-handwritten-number-classification
The objective of this problem is to implement the AdaBoost algorithm. We will test the algorithm on handwritten digits from the USPS data set.

**Steps:**

1.Implement the AdaBoost algorithm in R. The algorithm requires two auxiliary functions, to train and evaluate the weak learner. We also need a third function which implements the resulting boosting classifier. We will use decision stumps as weak learners, but a good implementation of the boosting algorithm should permit you to easily plug in arbitrary weak learners.

2.Implement the functions train and classify for decision stumps.

3.Run algorithm on the USPS data and evaluate the results using cross validation.

4.Plot the training error and the test error as a function of b.
